## 1. 📖 Abstract

This project presents a simulated dashboard for monitoring the health of CICS transactions in a mainframe-like environment. The application is developed using Python and Streamlit, simulating real-time transaction data including response times and statuses (Running, Warning, Critical). The system allows IT operations teams to proactively identify and respond to potential issues without depending on client-specific infrastructure.

---

## 2. 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate real-time CICS transaction logs
- Visualize transaction response times using bar charts
- Display transaction status distribution with pie charts
- Automatically highlight transactions with critical status
- Allow manual checking of specific transactions
